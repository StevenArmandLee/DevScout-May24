# Lesson Zero: Building a Scalable and Robust iOS App

## Introduction

In my Dev Scout talk on May 24, titled "**Lesson Zero**", I discussed how we can create a scalable and robust app by strengthening our foundation. It doesn't matter what kind of architecture you useâ€”as long as it works and is unit testable, it should scale effectively. This sample project demonstrates the SMB architecture that I created by following my principals, where most of the code is unit testable.

##Overview

This sample app showcases the SMB architecture, designed to ensure scalability and robustness through comprehensive unit testing.

Different minimum supporting OS versions have different flavors of SMB. For example, if you are using SwiftData, models can be owned by Screens/Views instead of ScreenModel.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt the SMB architecture to suit your project needs.

## Installation

To install the template for SMB, run the following script:

```bash
./install-xcode-template.sh
